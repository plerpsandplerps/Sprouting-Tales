# Challenges



Occasionally [Adventurers](Basics#Adventurer) will face tasks that are difficult for them to complete. These tasks are called **Challenges**.

## Resolving a Challenge

To resolve a Challenge the Adventurers are facing:
1. The Guide chooses the [Difficulty](Challenges#Difficulty) and sets that many World Tree Cards in a facedown pile for the Challenge. 
2. Any Player whose Adventurer is facing the Challenge may put a [Trait Card](TraitCards) from their Hand on top of their [Branches](CardZones.md#Branches) or their [Roots](CardZones.md#Roots).
2. Any Player whose Adventurer is facing the Challenge may choose to increase the Difficulty of the Challenge by one to [Discover](Challenges#Discover). If they do, that Player adds an additional facedown World Tree Card to the facedown pile for the Challenge.
3. The Guide turns all World Tree Cards in the facedown pile faceup.
4. Calculate an [Adventurer's Score](Challenges#Adventurer-Score). 
6. Any Player controlling an Adventurer facing the Challenge may [Kindle](CardZones.md#Kindling) any number of cards from their Branches. The Player turns one World Tree Card back facedown for each card the Player kindled.
7. Calculate the [Challenge's Score](Challenges#Challenge-Score).
8. If the Adventurer's Score is greater than or equal to the Challenge Score, the Adventurer is successful in overcoming the Challenge. Otherwise, the Adventurer fails to overcome the Challenge. 
9. Resolve any remaining [Boons or Bane World Tree Cards](Challenges#Special-World-Tree-Cards). 

## Difficulty

Challenges have a **Difficulty**, a number chosen by the [Guide](Basics#Guide) between one and ten. Once the Difficulty is chosen by the Guide, the Guide places that many [World Tree Cards](_drafts/WorldTreeCards.md) in a facedown pile. 

## Adventurer Score

An **Adventurer's Score** is equal to the value of the top card of their Player's Branches plus the top card of their Player's Roots. 

## Challenge Score

A **Challenge's Score** is equal to the sum of the values of all faceup World Tree Cards .

## Discover

When a Player whose Adventurer is facing a Challenge decides to **Discover,** they increase the Difficulty of the Challenge to gain the opportunity to learn something about the environment. 

After completing the eight steps above, any Player who decided to Discover may choose one World Tree Card from the World Tree Cards in the Challenge. That Player places the chosen World Tree Card faceup on top of their Branches. 

If multiple Players decided to Discover, then deal [Order Cards](docs/Introduction/OrderCards.md) to decide the order in which Players pick World Tree Cards to add to their Branches. 

## Special World Tree Cards

### Boons

When a **Boon World Tree Card** appears in a Challenge, the Adventurers facing the Challenge gain a minor benefit. Anybody in the group can suggest a minor benefit; however, the Guide has final say in what minor benefit the group receives. Some example minor benefits include:
- Lose a [Doubt](_drafts/ConsequenceCards.md#Doubt) or [Injury](_drafts/ConsequenceCards.md#Injury) card; 
- The Challenge takes less time to overcome;
- The cover opponents are hiding behind is destroyed; or
- The Adventurers gain a [Supply Card](_drafts/GearandSupplyCards.md#Supply-Cards). 

### Banes

When a **Bane World Tree Card** appears in a Challenge, the Adventurers facing the Challenge encounter a minor complication. Anybody in the group can suggest a minor complication; however, the Guide has final say in what minor complication the group receives. Some example minor complications include: 
- Drawing a Doubt or Injury card;
- Nearby characters are alerted to your presence;
- The cover the Adventurers are hiding behind is destroyed; or
- The Adventurers return a Supply Card.
