## Roles

Sprouting Tales is best played with 3-5 people. 

Once you've gathered a group, discuss what role each person wants to take on. Roles are not permanent, and the group should make adjustments when needed.
 
At least one person in the group takes on the role of the **Guide**. 
 
### Guide

The **Guide** describes the environments and the characters the Party interacts with. If there is a dispute about the rules or the rules do not cover something, the Guide serves as an arbitrator and makes rulings.

### Player and Adventurer

The participants other than the Guide are **Players** taking on the role of **Adventurers**. An Adventurer is the main character in the fictional story. Together, the Adventurers form a **Party**, a group of allies journeying together through the fictional narrative.

## How to Play a Tabletop Role-playing Game

When you are playing any Tabletop Role-playing Game, including Sprouting Tales, you are having a conversation. You are listening intently to the fictional story other people are creating and contributing your thoughts to this shared fiction.

Participants build on the contributions of others and share in this experience, where the ultimate goal is entertainment. Therefore, each participant serves as a steward of the other participants' fun. This responsibility begins and ends with respect and communication.

### Core Loop

The Guide begins the conversation by describing the environment and characters surrounding the Adventurers.

The players respond and describe what their Adventurer does in that situation. 

The Guide describes what happens as a result of the Adventurers' actions, and then describes the environment and characters surrounding the Adventurers again. 

## Rule Adjustments

The rules presented exist only as tools to facilitate the fun of the participants.

If certain rules are a barrier to your group's fun, discuss these issues. Then work in tandem with one another to create possible solutions and enact those agreed-upon changes.
