## Roles

Sprouting Tales is best played with 3-5 people. 

Once you've gathered a group, discuss what role each person will take on. These roles are not set in stone and the group should make adjustments when needed.
 
At least one person in the group takes on the role of the **Guide**. 
 
### Guide

The **Guide** describes the environments and the characters the Party interacts with. 

Additionally, if there is a dispute about the rules or the rules do not cover something, the Guide serves as an arbitrator and makes rulings.

### Adventurer

The participants other than the Guide take on the role of a **Player** controlling an **Adventurer**. An Adventurer is a main character in the story. Together the Adventurers form a **Party**, a group of allies journeying together through the fictional narrative.

## How to Play a Tabletop Roleplaying Game

When you are playing any Tabletop Roleplaying Game, including Sprouting Tales, you are having a conversation. You are listening intently on the fictional story other players are creating and contributing your thoughts to this shared fiction.

### Core Loop

The Guide begins the conversation by describing the environment the Adventurers are in.

The other players respond and describe what their Adventurer does in that environment. 

The Guide describes what happens as a result of the adventurers' actions and then describes the environment again. 

## Rule Adjustments

The rules presented exist only as tools to facilitate the fun of the participants.

If you feel certain rules are a barrier to your fun, discuss these issues with your group. Work in tandem with one another to create possible solutions and then enact those agreed upon changes.
