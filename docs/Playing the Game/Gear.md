## Gear

A Player's **Gear** is a faceup pile where they keep their [Component](Items#component). 

Players can only have one negative [Load](Items#load) card with the **Pack** card type and one negative Load card with the **Body** card type in their Gear. Players can have two negative Load cards with the **One-Hand** card type or one negative Load card with the **Two-Hand** card type in their Gear. 

Each Component has an effect and a trigger. The effect is continuous while the Component is on top of a Gear. When a Player completes the specified trigger, move that Component to the bottom of their Gear.

## Supplies

A Player's **Supply** is where they keep their [Supply](Items#supply).
