# Crafting

---

Players can **Craft** to add Components to their existing Gear.

To Craft, a Player takes the following steps in order: 

1. Declares one Supply as Crafting Tools. 
2. Adds a Component from an Item they own to their Gear.  Players cannot add Components with the same name as a Component already in their Gear. Players cannot add Components that would make their Weight go over zero. 
3. Return one Supply for each Component they added to their Gear.
4. Return the Item(s) they added Components from. 

If a Player cannot complete any of the above steps, then they cannot Craft. 

When calculating Weight, Players use the positive Weight for any Base Components they have added to their Gear through Crafting.
