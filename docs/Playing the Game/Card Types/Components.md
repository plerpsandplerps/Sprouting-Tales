Each Player chooses what Base Components in their Gear they are using as their Base Components. Players may choose up to one Base Component in their Gear for the Pack, Body, and Two hand subtype. If a Player does not choose a Base component of the Two hand subtype they may have up to two Versatile Base Components, two One hand Base Components, or one Versatile Base Component and one One hand Base Component. 

A Player may choose to use one Versatile Base Component and no One hand Components. If they do, they increase the effect of the chosen Versatile Base Component by one for all its numbered effects. 

Each Base Component has two Weights listed. If the Player chose a Base Component to be their Base Component of that subtype, they use the negative Weight. If the Player did not choose a Base Component to be their Base Component of that subtype, they use the positive Weight.
