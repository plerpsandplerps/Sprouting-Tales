# Traits

--- 

The core of an [Adventurer](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer) in Sprouting Tales is their personality. **Traits** are cards that act as a mechanical representation of that personality. Is your Adventurer funny? Smart? Kind? All of those things will be shown through Traits. 

## Playing Traits

When a Player role-plays their [Adventurer](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer) in a way that represents one of the Traits in their Hand, they may put that Trait on top of their Discard. 

When a Player role-plays their Adventurer in a way that represents the Trait on top of their Deck, they may put that Trait into their hand and place a Trait from their hand on top of their Discard. 

## Trait Explanation

Traits have the following characteristics: 

1. **Name:** The Name of a Trait describes the [Adventurer](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer). Players should rely on a Trait's name to decide how to role-play that Trait. 
2. **Type:** The type of Trait it is. 
3. **Level:** The Level of a Trait represents how powerful it is and is used when Players Share Discoveries. 
4. **Scores:** Every Trait has one Score listed on the front and another listed on the back. The Scores determine if an Adventurer is successful in overcoming a Challenge.   
5. **Trigger:** The Trigger on the front of a Trait states when the Effect occurs. Most Traits trigger when the Trait becomes the top of a Player's Discard.
6. **Effect:** The Effect of a Trait is resolved when the Trigger condition becomes true.
