# Traits

--- 

The core of an Adventurer in Sprouting Tales is not defined by their Ancestry or Path, but by who they are. **Traits** are cards that define what an Adventurer is like. Are they funny? Smart? Kind? or something else entirely? 

## Playing Traits

When a Player roleplays their Adventurer in a way that represents one of the Traits in their Hand, they may put that Trait on top of their Branches. 

When a Player roleplays their Adventurer in a way that represents the Trait on top of their Roots, they may put that Trait into their hand and place a Trait from their hand on top of their Branches. 

## Example Trait

Traits have the following characteristics: 

1. **Name:** The Name of a Trait describes the Adventurer. Rely on this to roleplay your Traits. 
2. **Type:** The type of Trait it is. 
3. **Level:** The Level of a Trait is used when Players Share Discoveries. 
4. **Scores:** Every Trait has one Score listed on the front and another listed on the back. The Scores are used to determine if an Adventurer is successful in overcoming a Challenge.   
5. **Trigger:** The Trigger on the front of a Trait states when the Effect will occur. Most Traits are triggered when the Trait becomes the top of a Player's branches.
6. **Effect:** The Effect of a Trait is resolved when the Trigger condition becomes true.
