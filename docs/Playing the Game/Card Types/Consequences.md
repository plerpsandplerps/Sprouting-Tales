# Consequences

As an Adventurer adventures, they may suffer Consequences. **Consequences** are a type of card that affects an Adventurer while it is in Play. Consequences can be beneficial or harmful. When an Adventurer gains a Consequence, that Player puts it into their Play. 

Every Consequence belongs to one of two categories:  
1. **Ongoing**; or,
2. **Conditions**.

## Ongoing

**Ongoing** Consequences are just that, ongoing. They are not returned when a Player Rests, and instead must be returned by a different effect.

Most Ongoing Consequences offer the Player the opportunity to return them, for a worse Consequence. For example, an Injury allows a Player to return all Injuries to put a Wound into Play.

## Conditions

**Conditions** are temporary Consequences, when a Player Rests they return all of their Conditions from Play. 

The first Condition an Adventurer gains has no effect outside its Score. When a Player would put a copy beyond the first of a Condition into play, the Player instead resolves the effect listed on the card.

Some Conditions have an opposite. When a Player would put a Condition into Play that is the opposite of one of the Conditions the Player already has in Play, the Player returns both Conditions instead.
