Fires spread throughout the World Tree and leave the World in disarray. Adventurers are continuously discovering and exploring this world. 

A **Discovery** is a card type used to create Challenges, advance [Adventurers](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer), and shape the World Tree.

## The World Tree and Sharing Discoveries

**The World Tree** is a card zone that represents the World the [Adventurer](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer)s are exploring. The World Tree can only have face-up Discoveries in it. 

Discoveries connect to other Discoveries along the black lines on their card faces. Connected Discoveries are in the same region of the World, while disconnected Discoveries represent different regions of the World.

When an [Adventurer](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer) Rests and their [Player](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer) has Discoveries in their Deck, then that Player **Shares Discoveries**. When any Player Shares Discoveries use Order to determine who acts when.

To Share Discoveries, all Players move all Discoveries from their Decks into their Hands. Whenever it is a Player's turn in the Order, they declare a Discovery from their hand as:

1. **Close;**
2. **Far;** or,
3. **Kindling**

### Close

When a [Player](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer) declares a Discovery as **Close**, they take the following steps in order: 

1. Connect the Discovery face-up to the World Tree;
2. Advance the Player's Order one;
3. Tell a Tale about this Discovery;
4. Draw six Level one [Traits](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Playing%20the%20Game/Card%20Types/Traits.html);
5. Pick two of the drawn Traits to add to their Deck; 
6. Tell a Tale about how their [Adventurer](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer) gained the chosen Traits; and, 
7. Return the remaining Traits in their Hand. 

If a Player is unable to take one of these steps, they cannot declare their Discovery as Close. 

### Far

When a [Player](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer) declares a Discovery as **Far**, they take the following steps in order:

1. Place the Discovery face-up in the Far zone;
2. Advance the Player's Order two;
3. Return two [Traits](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Playing%20the%20Game/Card%20Types/Traits.html) of the same Level from their Deck;
4. Draw three Traits one level higher than the returned cards;
5. Pick one of the drawn Traits to add to their Deck;
6. Tell a Tale about how their [Adventurer](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer) lost their Traits and gained the new chosen Trait; and,
7. Return the remaining Traits in their Hand.

If a Player is unable to take one of these steps, they cannot declare their Discovery as Far. 

### Kindling

When a [Player](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer) declares a Discovery as **Kindling**, they take the following steps in order: 

1. Place the Discovery face-up in the [Guide](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#guide)'s Kindling zone;
2. Advance the Player's Order three;
3. Return two [Traits](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Playing%20the%20Game/Card%20Types/Traits.html) of the same Level from their Deck; 
4. Choose an available Path of the same Level to add to their Deck; and,
5. Tell a Tale about how their [Adventurer](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer) lost their Traits and gained this new chosen Path. 

If a Player is unable to take one of these steps, they cannot declare their Discovery as Burning. 

### The World Tree Grows

Whenever it is the [Guide](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#guide)'s turn in the Order, the Guide **Grows the World Tree**, by taking the following steps in order: 

1. Connecting a Discovery of their choice from the Far zone to the World Tree;
2. Advance the Guide's Order one; 
3. Tell a Tale about this Discovery;

If the Guide is unable to take any of these steps, then the Guide takes none of these steps and advances their Order one instead.

### The Inferno Spreads

After everyone finishes Sharing Discoveries, the [Guide](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#guide) **Spreads the Inferno**. To Spread the Inferno, the Guide turns one Discovery on the World Tree horizontal for each Discovery in their Kindling zone. Then returns all Discoveries in their Kindling zone.  

When the Guide would turn a Discovery horizontal, but that Discovery is already horizontal, the Guide returns that Discovery instead.

### Creating Adventurers

If any [Player](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer) is creating an [Adventurer](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer), they place seven random Discoveries into their Deck. The Player Shares Discoveries as usual, except for two things: 

1. Players draw two random Discoveries whenever they advance their Order; and
2. Players return two Discoveries of their choice from their hand at the start of their turn in the Order. 

### Traversing the World Tree
 
[Adventurer](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer)s always exist in one of the Discoveries in the World Tree. When Adventurers travel by foot, they can move from one Discovery to an adjacent connected Discovery in one full day's travel.
