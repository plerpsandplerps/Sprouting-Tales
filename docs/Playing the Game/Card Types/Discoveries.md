Fires spread throughout the World Tree and leave the World in disarray. Adventurers are continuously discovering and exploring this world. 

A **Discovery** is a card type used to create Challenges, advance Adventurers, and shape the World Tree.

## The World Tree

**The World Tree** is a card zone that represents the World the Adventurers are exploring. The World Tree can only have faceup Discoveries in it. 

Discoveries are connected to other Discoveries by the black lines on their card faces. Connected Discoveries are in the same region of the World, while disconnected Discoveries represent different regions of the World.

### Sharing Discoveries

When an Adventurer Rests and their Player has Discoveries in their Roots, then that Player **Shares Discoveries**. When any Player Shares Discoveries use Order.

To Share Discoveries all Players move all Discoveries from their Roots into their Hand. Whenever it is a Player's turn in the Order, they declare a Discovery from their hand as:

1. **Close;**
2. **Far;** or,
3. **Kindling**

#### Close

When a Player declares a Discovery as **Close**, they take the following steps in order: 

1. Connect the Discovery faceup to the World Tree;
2. Advance the Player's Order one;
3. Tell a Tale about this Discovery;
4. Draw six Level one Traits;
5. Pick two of the drawn Traits to add to their Roots; 
6. Tell a Tale about how their Adventurer gained the chosen Traits; and, 
7. Return the remaining Traits in their Hand. 

If a Player is unable to take one of these steps, they cannot declare their Discovery as Close. 

#### Far

When a Player declares a Discovery as **Far**, they take the following steps in order:

1. Place the Discovery faceup in the Far zone;
2. Advance the Player's Order two;
3. Return two Traits of the same Level from their Roots;
4. Draw three Traits one level higher than the returned cards;
5. Pick one of the drawn Traits to add to their Roots;
6. Tell a Tale about how their Adventurer lost their Traits and gained the new chosen Trait; and,
7. Return the remaining Traits in their Hand.

If a Player is unable to take one of these steps, they cannot declare their Discovery as Far. 

#### Kindling

When a Player declares a Discovery as **Kindling**, they take the following steps in order: 

1. Place the Discovery faceup in the Guide's Kindling zone;
2. Advance the Player's Order three;
3. Return two Traits of the same Level from their Roots; 
4. Choose an available Path of the same Level to add to their Roots; and,
5. Tell a Tale about how their Adventurer lost their Traits and gained this new chosen Path. 

If a Player is unable to take one of these steps, they cannot declare their Discovery as Burning. 

#### The World Tree Grows

Whenever it is the Guide's turn in the Order, the Guide **Grows the World Tree**, by taking the following steps in order: 

1. Connecting a Discovery of their choice from the Far zone to the World Tree;
2. Advance the Guide's Order one; 
3. Tell a Tale about this Discovery;

If the Guide is unable to take any of these steps, then the Guide takes none of these steps and advances their Order one instead.

#### The Inferno Spreads

After everyone finishes Sharing Discoveries, the Guide **Spreads the Inferno**. To Spread the Inferno the Guide places one Kindling on one Discovery in the World Tree for each Discovery in their Kindling zone. Then returns all Discoveries in their Kindling zone.  

Whenever a Discovery in the World Tree has two Kindlings on it, return that Discovery. 

### Creating Adventurers

If any Player is creating an Adventurer, they place seven random Discoveries into their Roots. The Player Shares Discoveries as usual, except for two things: 

1. They draw two random Discoveries whenever they advance their Order; and
2. They return two Discoveries of their choice from their hand at the start of their turn in the Order. 

### Traversing the World Tree
 
Adventurers always exist in one of the Discoveries in the World Tree. When they travel by foot they can move from one Discovery to an adjacent connected Discovery in one full day's travel.
