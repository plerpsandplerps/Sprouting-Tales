# Supplies and Items

---

**Supplies** are the ordinary adventuring tools and simple items found while exploring. The common nature of these items lends them to be used as currency in the barter economy. 

[Player](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer)s keep their Supplies in their Play zone.

## Declaring Supplies

Supplies cannot be used until they are Declared.

A [Player](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer) can **Declare** a Supply by turning a Supply ninety degrees clockwise, and announcing out loud to the group what object the Supply is. A Declared Supply cannot be Declared again, until the [Adventurer](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer) Resupplies. 

The Player can only announce the Supply as an object that costs one Supply. The [Guide](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#guide) ultimately decides whether the object costs one Supply, but at a minimum, this includes:
- Torch
- Rope
- Empty Vial
- Long pole
- Fishing rod
- Bell
- Bedroll
- Candle
- Crowbar
- Trap
- Flint and tinder
- One day's rations for the Party
- Some Oil
- Tent
- Common Clothes
- Chalk
- Crafting Tools

The Player returns the Declared Supply if the Adventurer consumes, loses, or significantly damages the object in the fiction. 

## Resupply

When the Party spends some time at a well-supplied town, they **Resupply**. The [Player](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer)s may turn all of their horizontal Declared Supplies vertical. This represents the [Adventurer](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer)s bartering and exchanging their existing supplies for new ones. 

### Purchasing Items

While Resupplying, the [Adventurer](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer)s browse the local wares. 

The [Guide](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#guide) places five Supplies face-down, then turns these cards face-up to become Items. The Adventurers may return Supplies equal to an Item's cost to gain that Item. 

If multiple Adventurers want the same Item, use Order. The Adventurer who acts first may purchase the Item first, the Adventurer who acts second may purchase the Item second, and so on. 

### Purchasing Information

While the [Adventurer](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer)s Resupply, the [Guide](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#guide) places one Rare Item with its recipe side up. The Adventurers may return Supplies equal to that card's Rumor cost to learn a Rumor about the Rare Item's location. 

The Guide decides what the Rumor is and where the Rare Item is.

# Items

---

**Items** are the weapons, trinkets, and armor that [Adventurer](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer)s rely upon regularly. 

## Rarity

Every Item has one of three rarities: 
1. Common;
2. Uncommon; or,
3. Rare;

Common and Uncommon Items located are on the back of Supplies, while Rare Items are on Rare Item cards. There are three copies of every Common Item, two copies of every Uncommon Item, and one copy of every Rare Item.

## Slots

Each [Adventurer](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer) has four **Slots**, zones where they keep Supplies and Items. Each Slot can hold up to one Item or up to four Supplies. If an Adventurer does not have any Slots available to hold an Item or Supply, they cannot pick up that Item or Supply.

## Starting Items

Newly created [Adventurer](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer)s begin with seven Supplies. 

The Party then uses Order to take turns exchanging their Supplies for any number of Common Items they can afford and up to one Uncommon Item they can afford.  

## Finding Items 

When an [Adventurer](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer) finds loot while exploring, the [Guide](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#guide) asks the Player if their Adventurer found an Item or a Supply.

1. If they choose to find a Supply, they gain a Supply face-down. 
2. If they decide to find an Item, they gain a Supply face-down. Then turn that Supply face-up, making it an Item.
