# Order

**Order** is used to decide who goes first when the order actions occur is important. This rules document includes several instances where it calls for the use of Order. Outside of those instances, the Guide decides when the order actions occur is important enough to warrant the use of Order.

## Using Order

To use the Order to determine the order actions occur: 
1. The Guide declares the order actions occur is important; 
2. Each Player draws an Order and places it faceup in front of themselves; 
3. The Guide draws an Order for each character they control in the scene and places it face up for that character;
4. The person with the lowest faceup Order acts and turns their Order facedown; 
5. Repeat step three until all drawn Order are facedown;
6. After all drawn Order are facedown, shuffle all of the Order back together; 
7. Repeat steps one through five until the order actions occur is no longer important.

If there are not enough Orders for the Guide to draw one for each character they control, the Guide should instead draw a single Order. All of the Guide's characters act when that card is the lowest faceup Order. The Guide should also reconsider having this many characters in the scene.

## Wild Order

There is one Order with Wild written on it, this is the **Wild Order**. The person with the Wild Order can decide to have their character(s) act before any other person's character(s) acts. 

The person with the Wild Order must make this decision before the other person says what they are going to do when they act.
