# Items

---

On the faceup side of every Supply is an **Item**. There are two prominent numbers, one for the Item's Weight and one for the Item's Supplies. The Weight number is the Weight of the item. The Supplies number is how many Supplies you can expect to exchange the Item for when you trade. 

## Finding Items 

When an Adventurer finds some loot while exploring, the Guide asks the Player if their Adventurer found an Item or a Supply.

If they chose to find a Supply, they gain a Supply facedown. 

If they chose to find an Item, they gain a Supply facedown. Then turn that Supply faceup.

## Equipping Items

When an Adventurer equips an Item, they remove all Components of their currently equipped Item from their Gear. Then they add all components of the new Item to their Gear. 

## Missing Components

It's possible that while playing the game there are not enough of a Component for a Player to add it to their Gear. If this occurs, continue in the fiction under the assumption that the particular Component is damaged in this particular Item.
