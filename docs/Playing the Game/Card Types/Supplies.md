# Supplies

---

**Supplies** are the ordinary adventuring tools and simple items found while exploring. The common nature of these items lends them to be used as currency in the barter economy. 

Players  keep their Supplies in a space infront of themselves

Newly created Adventurers begin with # Supplies. 

## Declaring Supplies

Supplies cannot be used until they are Declared.

A player can **Declare** a Supply by turning a Supply ninety degrees clockwise, and announcing out loud to the group what object the Supply is. A Declared Supply cannot be Declared again, until the Adventurer Refreshes Supplies. 

The Player can only announce the Supply as an object that costs one Supply. The Guide ultimately decides whether the object costs one Supply, but at a minimum this would include:
- Torch
- Rope
- Empty Vial
- Long pole
- Fishing rod
- Bell
- Bedroll
- Candle
- Crowbar
- Trap
- Flint and tinder
- One day's rations for the Party
- Some Oil
- Tent
- Common Clothes
- Chalk

The Player returns the Declared Supply if the object is lost, consumed, or significantly damaged in the fiction. 

### Refresh Supplies

When the Party spends some time at a well-supplied town, they **Refresh Supplies**. The Players may turn all of their Declared Supplies back upright. This represents the Adventurers bartering and exchanging their existing supplies for new ones. 

### Load and Weight

Supplies have a Weight of one for the purpose of Load. A Player cannot have more Supplies than they have available Load.
