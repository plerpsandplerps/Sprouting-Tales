# Paths

--- 

**Paths** allow [Adventurer](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer)s to tap into the magic of the Inferno for their purposes. 

## Playing Paths

[Player](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer)s may put Paths into Play from their Hand at any time. When they do, they choose whether they want it to enter Play face-up or face-down. 

Players may put Paths into Play face-down from on top of their Deck at any time. 

Players may move Paths from Play to their Deck at any time. 

## Kindling Cost

On the face-up side of Path cards, a Kindling Cost is listed in the bottom right. The **Kindling Cost** is the number of cards the [Player](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer) must move from their Discard to their Kindling to activate the effect on their face-up Path. 

Players may pay this cost and activate the effect at any time.
