# Assisting in a Challenge

To assist in a Challenge, a Player must meet the following criteria: 

1. Have a Trait on top of their Deck;
2. Their [Adventurer](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer) cannot be facing the same Challenge; and
3. Their Adventurer is in the same area as the Adventurer facing the Challenge.

If the assisting Player meets the above criteria, then they may describe how the Trait on top of their Deck lets their Adventurer help the Adventurer facing the Challenge. 

Any number of Players who meet the above criteria can help the Adventurer facing the Challenge; however, only add the highest Score from the assisting Players' Deck to the Score of the Adventurer facing the Challenge.
