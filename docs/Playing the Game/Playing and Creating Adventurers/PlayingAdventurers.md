# Playing and Creating Adventurers

[Players](docs/Introduction/Basics#player-and-adventurer) begin the game as sleeping Adventurers who already have some experience adventuring under their belts. The Adventurers are dreaming of the burning World Tree.

## Creating and Advancing Adventurers

As experienced Adventurers, the Players begin with five Discoveries in their [Roots](docs/Playing%20the%20Game/Roots). 

Whenever a Player has a [Discovery](Discoveries) in their Roots while [Resting](Rest), they [share discoveries](Share-Discoveries).

## Player Card Zones

Players' cards always exist in a zone. Learn more about [Player Card Zones here](docs/Playing%20the%20Game/Playing%20and%20Creating%20Adventurers/PlayerCardZones).
