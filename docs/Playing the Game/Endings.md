# Ending

<img align="left" src="https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/artwork/Art_Ending.png" alt="Adventurer leaves by boat.">


At any point a Player may choose to have their Adventurer's Ending. 

An Ending can take many different forms: 
1. The Adventurer has died; 
2. The Adventurer is assumed to be dead;
3. The Adventurer no longer has an interest in Adventuring; or, 
4. Any other ending the Player thinks is appropriate for their Adventurer.

If the Player wants to continue playing, they may create a new Adventurer the next time Players Share Discoveries. 

## Goodbye

After an Adventurer has an Ending, all other Players and Adventurers have a **Goodbye**. 

During a Goodbye the Players talks about what aspects of the Ending Adventurer they enjoyed. Then Players speak as their own Adventurer saying goodbye to the Ending Adventurer. 

After the Goodbye, return all cards in the zones of the Ending Adventurer's Player.

## Dignity

The point of Endings is for Adventurers, and Players, to be able to exit games with dignity. 

Every other person in the group should react positively to an Ending and should not take it as an opportunity to belittle another Adventurer or another Player.
