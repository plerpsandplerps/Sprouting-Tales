## Deck

---

The **Deck** is a pile of face-down cards. Each Player has their own Deck. 

<!-- insert example here -->

When an [Adventurer](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer) begins a Rest, their Player returns all cards in their Play, Hand, Kindling, and Discard to their Deck.

When there are no more cards in a Player's Deck, that Player shuffles their Discard into their Deck. Then they gain Exhausted.  

A Player cannot look through the cards in their Deck nor change the order of the cards in their Deck.
