## Kindling

---

The **Kindling** is a pile of faceup cards. Each Player has their own Kindling. 

Kindling does not contribute to a Player's Score. 

When a Player Kindles a card they place it in their Kindling. 

<!-- insert example here -->

When there are no more cards in a Player's Roots and Branches, that Player shuffles their Kindling into their Roots.

A Player can freely look through the cards in their Kindling and rearrange the order of these cards.

*Note: Some players may find similarities between Kindling and the Removed From Game zones used in other games.*
