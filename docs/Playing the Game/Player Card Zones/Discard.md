## Discard

---

The **Discard** is a pile of face-up cards. Each [Player](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer) has their own Discard.  

A Player can look through the cards in their Discard, but they cannot change the order of the cards in their Discard.
