# Player Card Zones

The set of cards a [Player](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer) has are a physical representation of their fictional [Adventurer](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer). These cards always exist in a **Zone**, a space with defined characteristics.

<!--

## Example Player Layout

-->

## Deck

The **Deck** is a pile of face-down cards. Each [Player](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer) has their own Deck. When a Player's Deck is empty, they shuffle their Discard into their Deck and gain Exhausted.

<!-- insert example here -->

A Player cannot look through cards in their Deck nor change the order of cards in their Deck.

## Discard

The **Discard** is a pile of face-up cards. Each [Player](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer) has their own Discard.  

A Player can look through cards in their Discard, but they cannot change the order of cards in their Discard.

## Play

The **Play** zone is a space in front of a [Player](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer). Each player has their own Play zone. Typically, Play holds Paths or [Consequences](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Playing%20the%20Game/Card%20Types/Consequences.html).

## Kindling

The **Kindling** is a pile of face-up cards. Each [Player](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer) has their own Kindling. 

Kindling does not contribute to a Player's Score. 

<!-- insert example here -->

When there are no cards in a Player's Deck and Discard, that Player shuffles their Kindling into their Deck and gains Exhausted.

A Player can freely look through cards in their Kindling and change the order of those cards.

## Hand

A **Hand** refers to the cards a [Player](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer) holds in their hands and keeps hidden from the rest of the group. Each Player has their own Hand.

When a Player has fewer than two cards in their Hand, they draw cards from the top of their Deck until they have two cards in Hand.

There is no maximum number of cards a Player can have in their Hand. 

Players can discuss the cards in their Hand and freely change the order of cards in their Hand. The Group can choose to play with their Hands revealed.
