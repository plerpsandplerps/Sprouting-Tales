# Player Card Zones

The set of cards a [Player](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer) has are a physical representation of their fictional [Adventurer](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer). These cards always exist in a **Zone**, a space with defined characteristics. The zones are :

## Example Player Layout

## Deck

The **Deck** is a pile of face-down cards. Each [Player](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer) has their own Deck. 

<!-- insert example here -->

When there are no more cards in a Player's Deck, that Player shuffles their Discard into their Deck. Then they gain Exhausted.  

A Player cannot look through the cards in their Deck nor change the order of the cards in their Deck.

## Discard

The **Discard** is a pile of face-up cards. Each [Player](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer) has their own Discard.  

A Player can look through the cards in their Discard, but they cannot change the order of the cards in their Discard.

## Play

The **Play** zone is a space in front of a [Player](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer) where they keep certain cards. Each player has their own Play zone. Typically, the Play zone holds Paths or [Consequence](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Playing%20the%20Game/Card%20Types/Consequences.html)s.

## Kindling

The **Kindling** is a pile of face-up cards. Each [Player](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer) has their own Kindling. 

Kindling does not contribute to a Player's Score. 

When a Player Kindles a card, they place it in their Kindling. 

<!-- insert example here -->

When there are no more cards in a Player's Deck and Discard, that Player shuffles their Kindling into their Deck.

A Player can freely look through the cards in their Kindling and rearrange the order of these cards.

## Hand

A **Hand** refers to the cards a [Player](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#player-and-adventurer) holds in their hands and keeps hidden from the rest of the group. Each Player has their own Hand.

When a Player has fewer than two cards in their Hand, they draw cards from the top of their Deck until they have two cards in their Hand.

There is no maximum number of cards a Player can have in their Hand. 

Players can discuss the cards in their Hand and freely change the order of the cards in their Hand. Some groups, especially those with newer participants, can choose to play with all Hands revealed.
