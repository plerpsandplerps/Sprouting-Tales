## Roots

---

**Roots** are a pile of face down cards. Each Player has their own Roots. 

<!-- insert example here -->

When an Adventurer begins a Rest, their Player returns all cards in their Play, Hand, Kindling, and Branches to their Roots.

When there are no more cards in a Player's Roots, that Player shuffles their Branches into their Roots. Then they gain Exhausted.  

A Player cannot look through the cards in their Roots nor change the order of the cards in their Roots.

*Note: Some players may find similarities between Roots and the Decks used in other games.*
