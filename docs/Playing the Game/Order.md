# Order

---

**Order Cards** are used to decide who goes first when the order actions occur is important. This rules document includes several instances where it calls for the use of Order Cards. Outside of those instances, the [Guide](/docs/Introduction/Basics#guide) decides when the order actions occur is important enough to warrant the use of the Order cards. 

## Using Order Cards

To use the Order Cards to determine the order actions occur: 
1. The Guide declares the order actions occur is important; 
2. Each Player draws an Order Card and places it faceup in front of themselves; 
3. The Guide draws a card for each character they control in the scene and places it face up for that character;
4. The person with the lowest faceup Order Card acts and turns their Order Card facedown; 
5. Repeat step three until all drawn Order Cards are facedown;
6. After all drawn Order Cards are facedown, shuffle all of the Order Cards back together; 
7. Repeat steps one through five until the order actions occur is no longer important.

If there are not enough Order Cards for the Guide to draw one for each character they control, the Guide should instead draw a single Order Card. All of the Guide's characters act when that card is the lowest faceup Order Card. The Guide should also reconsider having this many characters in the scene.

## Wild Order Card

There is one Order Card with Wild written on it, this is the **Wild Order Card**. The person with the Wild Order Card can decide to have their character(s) act before any other person's character(s) acts. 

The person with the Wild Order Card must make this decision before the other person says what they are going to do when they act.
