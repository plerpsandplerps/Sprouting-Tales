## Kindling

The **Kindling** is a pile of face down cards. Each Player has their own Kindling. 

When a Player Kindles a card they place it in their Kindling. 

<!-- insert example here -->

When there are no more cards in a Player's Roots and Branches, that Player shuffles their Kindling into their Roots. Then that Player gains [Exhausted](Consequences#exhausted)

A Player can freely look through the cards in their Kindling and rearrange the order of these cards.
