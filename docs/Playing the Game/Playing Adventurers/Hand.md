### Hand

A **Hand** refers to the cards a Player holds in their hands and keeps hidden from the rest of the group. Each Player has their own Hand.

When a Player has fewer than two cards in their Hand, they draw cards from the top of their Roots until they have two cards in Hand.

There is no maximum number of cards a Player can have in their Hand. 

When an Adventurer finishes a Rest, they shuffle their Roots then draw the top two cards in their Roots into their Hand. 

Players can discuss the cards in their Hand and freely change the order of the cards in their Hand. Some groups, especially those with newer participants, can choose to play with all Hands revealed.
