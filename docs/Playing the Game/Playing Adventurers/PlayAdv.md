# Playing and Creating Adventurers

[Players](Basics#player-and-adventurer) begin the game as sleeping Adventurers who already have some experience adventuring under their belts. The Adventurers are dreaming of the burning World Tree.

## Creating and Advancing Adventurers

As experienced Adventurers, the Players begin with five Discoveries in their [Roots](docs/Playing%20the%20Game/Playing%20Adventurers/Roots.md). 

Whenever a Player has a [Discovery](Discoveries) in their Roots while [Resting](Rest), they [share discoveries](Share-Discoveries).
