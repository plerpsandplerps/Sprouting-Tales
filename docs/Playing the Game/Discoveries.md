# Discoveries

---

Fires burn across the World Tree and leave the World in disarray. The World rearranges itself as its branches crumble to ash and the Inferno creates new divides. Adventurers are continuously discovering and exploring this world. 

A **Discovery** is a card type used to create Challenges, advance Adventurers, and shape the World Tree.

## World Tree

**The World Tree** is a card zone that represents the World the Adventurers are exploring. The World Tree can only have Discoveries in it. 

Discoveries can be connected by the black lines on their cards. Connected Discoveries are considered to be in the same region of the World. Disconnected Discoveries are in different regions of the World.

At the start of a Campaign, the Guide draws nine Discoveries and picks three to place into the World Tree connected to one another. The Guide then returns the remaining Discoveries. The Guide tells a Tale for each of the placed Discoveries.

 ### Traversing the World Tree

 Adventurers always exist in one of the Discoveries in the World Tree. When they travel by foot they can move from one Discovery to an adjacent connected Discovery in one full day's travel. 

 Any Discoveries that are disconnected from the Adventurers are assumed to be separated from the current region by the Inferno.

## Gaining Discoveries

Players start with five Discoveries in their Roots when they create their Adventurer. After that point, the only way Players gain Discoveries is by Discovering during a Challenge.

## Sharing Discoveries

When an Adventurer Rests and their Player has Discoveries in their Roots, then that Player **Shares Discoveries**.

To Share a Discovery a Player declares the Discovery as: 
1. **Close**
2. **Far**
3. **Burning**

If multiple Players are Sharing Discoveries during one Rest, then use Order.

### Close

When a Player declares a Discovery as **Close**, they take the following steps in order: 
1. Connect the Discovery faceup to an existing branch of the World Tree;
2. Tell a Tale about this Discovery;
3. Draw six Traits with a score of plus one on their back;
4. Pick two of the drawn Traits to add to their Roots; 
5. Tell a Tale about how their Adventurer gained the chosen Traits; and, 
5. Return the remaining Traits in their Hand. 

If a Player is unable to take one of these steps, they cannot declare their Discovery as Close. 

### Far

When a Player declares a Discovery as **Far**, they take the following steps in order:
1. Place the Discovery faceup in the Far zone;
2. Return two Traits with the same score on the back from their Roots;
3. Draw three Traits with a score one higher than the returned cards on the back;
4. Pick one of the drawn Traits to add to their Roots;
5. Tell a Tale about how their Adventurer lost their Traits and gained this new chosen Trait; and,
6. Return the remaining Traits in their Hand.

If a Player is unable to take one of these steps, they cannot declare their Discovery as Far. 

### Burning

When a Player declares a Discovery as **Burning**, they take the following steps in order: 
1. Return the Discovery;
2. Return two Traits with the same score on the back from their Roots; 
3. Choose an available Path with the same score on the back to add to their Roots; and,
4. Tell a Tale about how their Adventurer lost their Traits and gained this new chosen Path. 

If a Player is unable to take one of these steps, they cannot declare their Discovery as Burning. 

### The Inferno Spreads

After all Players finish Sharing Discoveries, the Guide **Spreads the Inferno**. The Guide returns a Discovery from each set of connected Discoveries. The Guide cannot return the Discovery the Adventurers are currently on. 

### The World Tree Grows

After spreading the Inferno, the Guide **Grows the World Tree**. The Guide may connect any number of Discoveries in the Far pile to Discoveries in the World Tree, or they may place any number of Discoveries disconnected in the World Tree. For each placed Discovery the Guide tells a tale.
