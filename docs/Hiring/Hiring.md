# Hiring Artists

Hi everyone,
I am looking to commission a few test pieces from a variety of artists. These pieces would be used as test pieces in Sprouting Tales. The pieces would help me hone in on an art style for the game and find artists when I need to commission the full artwork for the full game.

I have a [Pinterest board ](https://pin.it/4oBMQXQ) with some style ideas I am considering. Generally, I am looking for:
- Flat Color (almost comic book-like)
- Neon palette (cyberpunk pinks, blues, greens, pastels, oranges)
- Fantasy (The game is a fantasy game about a burning world)
- Splash of weirdness (The world is crumbling and magical energies lay latent everywhere)
- Magical Fires (Magic is fueled by burning off bits of yourself)

If you think you might be a good fit, DM me a link to your portfolio and some of your work below!

The rate is negotiable. $20-$40 per piece.

(or feel free to share details with friends you think might fit!)
