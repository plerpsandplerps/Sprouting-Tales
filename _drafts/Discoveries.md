# Discoveries

---

Fires spread throughout the World Tree and leave the World in disarray. Adventurers are continuously discovering and exploring this world. 

A **Discovery** is a card type used to create Challenges, advance Adventurers, and shape the World Tree.

## World Tree

**The World Tree** is a card zone that represents the World the Adventurers are exploring. The World Tree can only have faceup Discoveries in it. 

Discoveries are connected to other Discoveries by the black lines on their card faces. Connected Discoveries are in the same region of the World, while disconnected Discoveries represent different regions of the World.

## Sharing Discoveries

When an Adventurer Rests and their Player has Discoveries in their Roots, then that Player **Shares Discoveries**.

To Share a Discovery a Player declares the Discovery as: 
1. **Close**
2. **Far**
3. **Burning**

If multiple Players are Sharing Discoveries during one Rest, then use Order.

### Close

When a Player declares a Discovery as **Close**, they take the following steps in order: 

1. Connect the Discovery faceup to an existing branch of the World Tree;
2. Tell a Tale about this Discovery;
3. Draw six Level one Traits;
4. Pick two of the drawn Traits to add to their Roots; 
5. Tell a Tale about how their Adventurer gained the chosen Traits; and, 
5. Return the remaining Traits in their Hand. 

If a Player is unable to take one of these steps, they cannot declare their Discovery as Close. 

### Far

When a Player declares a Discovery as **Far**, they take the following steps in order:

1. Place the Discovery faceup in the Far zone;
2. Return two Traits of the same Level from their Roots;
3. Draw three Traits one level higher than the returned cards;
4. Pick one of the drawn Traits to add to their Roots;
5. Tell a Tale about how their Adventurer lost their Traits and gained the new chosen Trait; and,
6. Return the remaining Traits in their Hand.

If a Player is unable to take one of these steps, they cannot declare their Discovery as Far. 

### Burning

When a Player declares a Discovery as **Burning**, they take the following steps in order: 

1. Return the Discovery;
2. Return two Traits of the same Level from their Roots; 
3. Choose an available Path of the same Level to add to their Roots; and,
4. Tell a Tale about how their Adventurer lost their Traits and gained this new chosen Path. 

If a Player is unable to take one of these steps, they cannot declare their Discovery as Burning. 

### The Inferno Spreads

After all Players finish Sharing Discoveries, the Guide **Spreads the Inferno**. The Guide returns a Discovery from each set of connected Discoveries. The Guide cannot return the Discovery the Adventurers are currently on. 

### The World Tree Grows

After spreading the Inferno, the Guide **Grows the World Tree**. The Guide may connect any number of Discoveries in the Far pile to Discoveries in the World Tree, or they may place any number of Discoveries disconnected in the World Tree. For each placed Discovery the Guide tells a tale.  

### Traversing the World Tree
 
Adventurers always exist in one of the Discoveries in the World Tree. When they travel by foot they can move from one Discovery to an adjacent connected Discovery in one full day's travel.
