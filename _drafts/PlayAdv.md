# Playing Adventurers

Players begin the game as Adventurers who already have some experience adventuring under their belts. 

## Adventurer Mechanics

The set of cards a Player has represents their Adventurer. These cards always exist in a **Zone**, a space with defined characteristics. 

### Hand

A **Hand** refers to the cards a Player holds in their hands and keeps hidden from the rest of the group. Each Player has their own Hand.

When a Player has fewer than two cards in their Hand, they draw cards from the top of their Roots until they have two cards in Hand.

There is no maximum number of cards a Player can have in their Hand. 

When an Adventurer finishes a Rest, they shuffle their Roots then draw the top two cards in their Roots into their Hand. 

Players can discuss the cards in their Hand and freely change the order of the cards in their Hand. Some groups, especially those with newer participants, can choose to play with all Hands revealed.

## Roots

**Roots** are a pile of facedown cards. Each Player has their own Roots. 

<!-- insert example here -->

When an Adventurer begins a [Rest](Rest), their Player returns all cards in their Play, Hand, Kindling, and Branches to their Roots.

When there are no more cards in a Player's Roots, that Player shuffles their Branches into their Roots. Then they gain [Exhausted](fixlink).  

A Player cannot look through the cards in their Roots nor change the order of the cards in their Roots.

## Branches

**Branches** are a pile of faceup cards. Each Player has their own Branch.  

A Player can look through the cards in their Branches, but they cannot change the order of the cards in their Branches.

## Kindling

The **Kindling** is a pile of face down cards. Each Player has their own Kindling. 

When a Player Kindles a card they place it in their Kindling. 

<!-- insert example here -->

When there are no more cards in a Player's Roots and Branches, that Player shuffles their Kindling into their Roots. Then that Player gains [Exhausted](fixlink)

A Player can freely look through the cards in their Kindling and rearrange the order of these cards.

## Play

Each Player has their own **Play** zone which is just the space in front of them. Cards in this zone have various effects while they are in Play. 

## Gear Deck

A Player's **Gear Deck** is where they keep their Component Cards. 

Players can only have one negative load card for their pack and body, but can have two negative load cards for their hands.

Each Component Card has an effect and a trigger. The effect is continuous while the Component Card is on top of a Gear Deck. When a Player completes the specified trigger, move that card to the bottom of the Gear Deck. 

## Supply

A Player's **Supply** is where they keep their [Supply Cards](SupplyCards).
