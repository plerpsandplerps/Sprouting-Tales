Adventurers grow while they are in the Abyss...


After a Player connects a Seed Card to a World Branch or begins a new World Branch, players choose to do one of the following:

1. **Gain two Tier 1 Trait Cards**: Draw four Tier 1 Trait Cards and choose two to add to their deck. 
2. **Upgrade Trait Cards**: Remove two Trait Cards of the same tier from their deck. Draw two Trait Cards that are one tier higher than the removed cards. They Choose one to add to their deck. 
3. **Gain a Tier 1 Path or Ancestry Card**: Remove two Tier 1 Trait Cards from your deck. Choose a Ancestry Card or Path Card of the same tier to add to your deck.
4. **Gain a higher tier Path or Ancestry Card**: Remove two Ancestry Cards of the same tier, two Path Cards of the same tier, or one Path Card and one Ancestry Card of the same tier. Choose an Ancestry or Path Card, that is one tier higher than the removed cards, to add to your deck. The chosen card must be the same Path or Ancestry as one of the removed cards.

Whenever a Player chooses to a card to add to their deck, they cannot choose a card that is in another Player's deck.
