# Goals and Conflicts

---

Occasionally, the shared narrative demands more attention than a simple Challenge resolution. In these cases, the [Guide](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#guide) calls for the group to use Goals.

A **Goal** is a simple one-sentence description of what a character wants. 

### Advancing a Goal

Whenever a Character takes an action in the narrative, they may choose to have that action **Advance a Goal**. 

If there are no existing Goals they would like to advance, they may set a new Goal. 

### Obstructing a Goal 



## Conflicts

When two or more Characters have Goals that cannot coexist and these characters are in each others' presence, then it is a **Conflict**.  Conflicts should be resolved when they occur. 

### Resolving Conflicts

When resolving a Conflict use Order.
