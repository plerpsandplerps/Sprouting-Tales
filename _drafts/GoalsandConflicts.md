# Goals and Conflicts

---

Occasionally, the shared narrative demands more attention than a simple Challenge resolution. In these cases, the Guide calls for the group to use Goals.

A **Goal** is a simple one sentence description of what a character wants. 

### Advancing a Goal

Whenever a Character takes an action in the narrative, they may choose to have that action **Advance a Goal**. 

If they are no existing Goals they would like to advance, they may set a new Goal. 

### Obstructing a Goal 



## Conflicts

When two or more Characters have Goals which cannot coexist, then it is a **Conflict**. If all the Goals Characters have can come to fruition, then there is no Conflict.
