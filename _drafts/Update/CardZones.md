# Card Zones

---

Cards always exist in a **Zone**, a space with defined characteristics.

### Hand

A **Hand** refers to the cards the Player holds in their hands and keeps hidden from the rest of the group. Each Player has their own Hand.  

When a Player has fewer than two cards in their Hand, they draw cards from the top of their Roots until they have two cards in Hand.

There is no maximum number of cards a Player can have in their Hand. 

When an Adventurer finishes a Rest, they shuffle their Roots then draw the top two cards in their Roots into their Hand. 

Players can freely change the order of cards in their Hand and discuss the cards in their Hand.

## Roots

**Roots** are a pile of facedown cards. Each Player has their own Roots. 

<!-- insert example here -->

When an Adventurer begins a [Rest](Rest), they return all cards in their Hand, Kindling, and Branches to their Roots.

When there are no more cards in a Player's Roots, that Player shuffles their Branches into their Roots. Then that Player chooses to draw an [Injury](Injury) or a [Doubt](Doubt).

A Player cannot look through the cards in their Roots nor change the order of the cards in their Roots.

## Branches

**Branches** are a pile of faceup cards. Each Player has their own Branch. 

When a card becomes the top of a Player's Branches, that Player activate its effect, unless the card has a specified trigger. 

<!-- insert example here -->
 
In the above example, the effect occurs when the card is Kindled instead of when it is placed on top of a Player's Branches.  

A Player can look through the cards in their Branches, but they cannot change the order of the cards in their Branches.

## Kindling

The **Kindling** is a pile of face down cards. Each Player has their own Kindling. 

When a Player Kindles a card they place it in their Kindling. 

<!-- insert example here -->

When there are no more cards in a Player's Roots and Branches, that Player shuffles their Kindling into their Roots. Then that Player chooses to draw an [Injury](Injury) or a [Doubt](Doubt). 

A Player can freely look through the cards in their Kindling and rearrange the order of these cards.
