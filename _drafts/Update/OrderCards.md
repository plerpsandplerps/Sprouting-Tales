## Order Cards

**Order Cards** are used when the order actions occur is important. Generally the Guide decides when the order actions occur is important; however, the rules explicitly call for the use Order Cards in certain scenarios.

To use the Order Cards: 
1. Each Player draws one Order Card and places it faceup in front of themselves.
2. The Guide then draws a card for each Character they control in the scene and places it face up for that Character. If there are not enough Order Cards left, the Guide instead draws a single card for all Characters they control in the scene. 
3. The person with the lowest numbered Order Card may act. 
4. Then the person with the second lowest numbered Order Card acts second, and so on in ascending order. 

After a person acts, they turn their Order Card facedown.

When every person has acted and all Order Cards are facedown, shuffle the Order Cards together and repeat the steps above.

### Wild

One Order Card doesn't have a number listed and instead has the word **Wild** on its face. The person with the Wild Order Card can decide to act before any other person acts. After the person with the Wild Order Card acts, they turn their Order Card face down as usual. 

The Wild Order Card holder cannot wait to hear what another person is doing before deciding if they will act before that person.
