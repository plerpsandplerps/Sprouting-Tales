# Introduction

Sprouting Tales is a Tabletop Roleplaying Game, or TTRPG. As a participant, you build on the contributions of others and share in an experience where the ultimate goal is entertainment. Therefore, each participant serves as a steward of each other participant's fun. This responsibility begins and ends with respect and communication.

## Communication Tools

<!--
The communication tools below are provided to help improve communication. If a player uses one of these tools, do not respond by attempting to push their boundaries. Instead, recognize something in the scene causes discomfort and change the direction of the scene. 

These tools, although helpful, are no substitute for situational awareness and communication. A shy participant might not be able to assert a tool in the moment, but an aware group can still recognize and avoid discomfort. 

Discuss among your group what safety tools you'll be using out of the following:

- [Lines](Communication###Lines)
- [Veils](Communication###Veils)
- [More Card](Communication###More%20Card)
- [Less Card](Communication###Less%20Card)
- [X Card](Communication###X%20Card)

Discuss Themes and Topics

<!--
### Lines

Lines are topics or themes that will never come up during play. The group should keep an ongoing list of lines and players may add new lines to the list at any time. 

Example lines include:
- Detailed Violence or Gore
- Non-consensual sexual acts

### Veils

Veils are topics or themes that may come up during play, but when they do they will be mentioned only in passing. They should never be the focus of a scene and should never be in the spotlight. The group should keep an ongoing list of veils and players may add new  veils to the list at any time.

Example veils include:
- Consensual sexual acts
- Violence

### More Card

There is a card with the word **More** written on it. This card should be kept in reach of all players. If another player is roleplaying something you would like to see more of, tap this card.

### Less Card

There is a card with the word **Less** written on it. This card should be kept in reach of all players. If another players is roleplaying something you would like to see less of, tap this card.

If the Less Card and the More Card are tapped in response to the same roleplaying, ignore the More Card.

### X Card

There is a card with a large X and the word **Stop** written on it. This card must be kept in reach of all players. If another player is doing something you do not want to roleplay, tap this card.
