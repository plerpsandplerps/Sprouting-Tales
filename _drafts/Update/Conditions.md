# Conditions

The first time you gain a condition nothing happens, you are an Adventurer and are used to dealing with mild difficulties. Any time you gain a condition after the first, you immediately resolve the effect listed below:

1. **AFRAID**: Draw a Doubt.
2.  **COLD**: Turn your Order Card facedown.
3. **EXHAUSTED**: Choose Doubt or Injury, then draw the chosen card.
4. **ILLUMINATED**: Draw a card. 
6. **OBSURED**: Discard a card.
7. **POISONED**: Draw a Wound.
8. **REFRESHED**: Move any card from your Discard to the bottom of your Deck. 
9. **SATED**: Remove an Injury or Doubt from your Branch.
10. **TERRIFIED**: Draw a Despair.
11. **WARM**: Draw an Injury.

When an Adventurer has one of the following pairs of conditions, they immediately lose both conditions:
1. **COLD and WARM**
2. **ILLUMINATED and OBSCURED**
3. **EXHAUSTED and REFRESHED**
