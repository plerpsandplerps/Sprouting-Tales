# Advancing and Creating Adventurers

Players begin the game as sleeping Adventurers who already have some experience adventuring under their belts. The Adventurers are dreaming of the burning World Tree. As experienced Adventurers, the Players begin with five Discoveries in their Roots. 

When a Player has a Discovery in their Roots when their Adventurer Rests, the Player Shares Discoveries and their Adventurer dreams of the burning World Tree.
