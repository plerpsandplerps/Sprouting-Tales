# Discoveries

---

Fires burn across the World Tree and leave the World in disarray. The World rearranges itself as its branches crumble to ash and the Inferno creates new divides. Adventurers are continuously discovering and exploring this world. 

A **Discovery** is a card type used for creating Challenges, Adventurer's advancement, and shaping the World Tree.

## Gaining Discoveries

Players start the game with five Discoveries in their Roots. Then from that point on Players gain Discoveries when they Discover during a Challenge.

## Sharing Discoveries

When an Adventurer Rests and their Player has Discoveries in their Roots, then that Player **Shares Discoveries**. That Player places one of their Discoveries onto the World in one of three ways: 

1. Branches
2. Roots
3. Kindling
