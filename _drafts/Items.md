# Items

---

On the faceup side of every Supply is an **Item**. 

### Finding Items 

When an Adventurer finds some loot while exploring, the Guide asks the Player if their Adventurer found an Item or a Supply.

If they chose to find a Supply, they gain a Supply facedown. 

If they chose to find an Item, they gain a Supply facedown. Then turn that Supply faceup.

## Components

When an Adventurer equips an Item, the Player returns all Components from the related Gear. Then adds the new Item's listed Components to their Gear. 

Each Component has an effect and a trigger. The effect is continuous while the Component is on top of one of the Player's Gear. When a Player completes the specified trigger, move that Component to the bottom of the Player's Gear.

## Crafting

A player can add Components from an Item they have to their existing Gear by **Crafting**.
