# Items

---

On the faceup side of every Supply is an **Item**. There are also two numbers, one for the Item's Weight and one for the Item's Supplies. The Weight number is the Weight of the item. The Supplies number is how many Supplies you can expect to exchange the Item for when you trade. 

## Finding Items 

When an Adventurer finds some loot while exploring, the Guide asks the Player if their Adventurer found an Item or a Supply.

If they chose to find a Supply, they gain a Supply facedown. 

If they chose to find an Item, they gain a Supply facedown. Then turn that Supply faceup.


## Equipping Items

When a Player has their Adventurer equip an Item they remove whatever Components they currently have for that for that Base Component Type in their Gear. Then they add the Components of the Item they are equipping to their Gear.
