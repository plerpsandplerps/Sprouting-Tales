# Items

---

On the faceup side of every Supply is an **Item**. There are two prominent numbers, one for the Item's Weight and one for the Item's Supplies. The Weight number is the Weight of the item. The Supplies number is how many Supplies you can expect to exchange the Item for when you trade. 

## Finding Items 

When an Adventurer finds some loot while exploring, the Guide asks the Player if their Adventurer found an Item or a Supply.

If they choose to find a Supply, they gain a Supply facedown. 

If they choose to find an Item, they gain a Supply facedown. Then turn that Supply faceup, making it an Item.
