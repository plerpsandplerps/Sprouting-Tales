# Items

## Supply Cards



### Did you find a supply? 

When an Adventurer finds items during their adventure, the Guide will ask the Player if they found an item or a supply.

If they choose to find an item, they gain faceup Supply Card.

If they choose to find a supply, they gain a facedown Supply Card.
