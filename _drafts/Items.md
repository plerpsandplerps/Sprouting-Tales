# Equipment

## Supplies

**Supplies** are the ordinary adventuring tools and simple items found while exploring. The common nature of these items lends them to be used as currency in the barter economy. 

Players  keep their Supplies in a space infront of themselves

Newly created Adventurers begin with # Supplies. 

### Declaring Supplies

Supplies cannot be used until they are Declared.

A player can Declare a Supply by turning a facedown Supply ninety degrees clockwise, and announcing out loud to the group what the Supply is.

The Player can only announce the Supply as an object that costs one Supply. The Guide ultimately decides whether the object costs one Supply, but at a minimum this would include:
- Torch
- Rope
- Empty Vial
- Long pole
- Fishing rod
- Bell
- Bedroll
- Candle
- Crowbar
- Trap
- Flint and tinder
- One day's rations for the Party
- Some Oil
- Tent
- Common Clothes
- Chalk

The Player returns the Declared Supply if the object is lost, consumed, or significantly damaged.

### Refresh Supplies

When the Party spends some time at a well-supplied town, they **Refresh Supplies**. The Players may turn all of their Declared Supplies back upright. This represents the Adventurers bartering and exchanging their existing supplies for new ones. 

## Items

On the faceup side of every Supply is an **Item**. 

### Finding Items 

When an Adventurer finds some loot while exploring, the Guide asks the Player if their Adventurer found an Item or a Supply.

If they chose to find a Supply, they gain a Supply facedown. 

If they chose to find an Item, they gain a Supply facedown. Then turn that Supply faceup.

## Components

When an Adventurer equips an Item, the Player returns all Components from the related Gear. Then adds the new Item's listed Components to that Gear. 

Each Component has an effect and a trigger. The effect is continuous while the Component is on top of one of the Player's Gears. When a Player completes the specified trigger, move that Component to the bottom of its Gear.

## Crafting

When an Adventurer Rests, they may decide to **Craft**. To Craft the Player takes the following steps in order:
1. Return one Supply;
2. Choose a Component listed on an Item you own;
3. Add that Component to its Gear.
