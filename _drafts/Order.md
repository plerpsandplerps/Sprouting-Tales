# Order

Use **Order** to decide which Character and/or Player acts first. The group should not need to use Order at all times, but instead only use Order when the [Guide](https://plerpsandplerps.github.io/Sprouting-Tales/docs/Introduction/Basics.html#guide) deems it appropriate. 

Every Order is a pair of two cards with the same text and icon. At the beginning of each session or at the beginning of a campaign, each person in the group chooses one pair of Orders. 

Whenever Order is important shuffle one card from each person's pair of Orders together face-down, then flip the deck of cards face-up.
