# Order

**Order** is used to decide which Character and Player acts first when the order actions occur is important. The Guide decides when the order actions occur is important enough to warrant the use of Order. 

Every Order is one of a pair of two cards with the same text and icon. At the beginning of each session or at the beginning of a campaign, each person in the group chooses one pair of Orders. 

Whenever Order is important shuffle one card from each person's pair of Orders together facedown, then flip the deck of cards faceup.
