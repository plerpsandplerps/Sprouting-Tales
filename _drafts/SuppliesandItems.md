# Supplies

---

**Supplies** are the ordinary adventuring tools and simple items found while exploring. The common nature of these items lends them to be used as currency in the barter economy. 

Players keep their Supplies in their Play zone.

## Declaring Supplies

Supplies cannot be used until they are Declared.

A player can **Declare** a Supply by turning a Supply ninety degrees clockwise, and announcing out loud to the group what object the Supply is. A Declared Supply cannot be Declared again, until the Adventurer Refreshes Supplies. 

The Player can only announce the Supply as an object that costs one Supply. The Guide ultimately decides whether the object costs one Supply, but at a minimum this would include:
- Torch
- Rope
- Empty Vial
- Long pole
- Fishing rod
- Bell
- Bedroll
- Candle
- Crowbar
- Trap
- Flint and tinder
- One day's rations for the Party
- Some Oil
- Tent
- Common Clothes
- Chalk
- Crafting Tools

The Player returns the Declared Supply if the object is lost, consumed, or significantly damaged in the fiction. 

## Resupply

When the Party spends some time at a well-supplied town, they **Resupply**. The Players may turn all of their horizontal Declared Supplies vertical. This represents the Adventurers bartering and exchanging their existing supplies for new ones. 

### Purchasing Items

While Resupplying, the Adventurers browse the local wares. 

The Guide places five Supplies facedown then turns these cards faceup to become Items. The Adventurers may return Supplies equal to an Item's cost to gain that Item. 

If multiple Adventurers want the same Item, use Order. The Adventurer who acts first may purchase the Item first, the Adventurer who acts second may purchase the Item second, and so on. 

### Purchasing Information

While the Adventurers Resupply, the Guide places one Rare Item with its recipe side up. The Adventurers may return Supplies equal to that card's Rumor cost to learn a Rumor about the Rare Item's location. 

The Guide decides what the Rumor is and where the Item is located.

# Items

On the faceup side of every Supply is an **Item**. 

## Finding Items 

When an Adventurer finds loot while exploring, the Guide asks the Player if their Adventurer found an Item or a Supply.

If they choose to find a Supply, they gain a Supply facedown. 

If they choose to find an Item, they gain a Supply facedown. Then turn that Supply faceup, making it an Item.

## Starting Items

Newly created Adventurers begin with seven Supplies.
