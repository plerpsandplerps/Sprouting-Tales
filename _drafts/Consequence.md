# Consequences

As an Adventurer adventures, they may suffer Consequences. **Consequences** are effects an Adventurer is under the influence of. Consequences are not necessarily beneficial or hurtful. When an Adventurer gains a Consequence their Player puts it into their Play. 

Every Consequence belongs to one of two categories:  
1. **Ongoing**; or,
2. **Conditions**.

## Ongoing

**Ongoing** are just that, ongoing. They are not returned when a Player Rests. If a Player's Ongoing Consequences aren't returned by an effect, a Player will have them forever.

### Injury



### Wound



### Ghost



### Doubt



### Despair



### Husk



## Conditions

**Conditions** are temporary Consequences, when a Player Rests they return all of their Conditions from Play. 

The first Condition an Adventurer gains has no effect outside of its score. When a Player would put a copy beyond the first of a Condition into play, they instead resolve the effect listed on the card.

Some Conditions have an opposite. When a Player would put a Condition into Play that is the opposite of one of the Conditions the Player already has in Play, the Player instead returns both Conditions.
